# Obesity-Classifier-Machine-Learning
  > Developed an obesity classifier using machine learning techniques with a dataset from Kaggle.

  > Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization using Matplotlib.

  > Utilized 16 independent variables for model training.
  
  > Implemented and evaluated five classification algorithms: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosted Trees.
  
  > Achieved 97% test accuracy with Gradient Boosted Trees.
